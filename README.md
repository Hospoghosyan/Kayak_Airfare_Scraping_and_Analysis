# Kayak Airfare Scraping and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves scraping airfare data from Kayak using Selenium, followed by cleaning and analyzing the data to explore pricing trends.The scraper collects airfare information for various flight routes between Yerevan (EVN) and multiple cities in Saudi Arabia (SA) over different time frames (1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month) and across different months (November, January, February, etc.). The collected data includes flight prices, departure and arrival times, airlines, layovers, and more. The analysis helps users understand patterns in airfare based on factors like trip duration, destination, airline, time of booking and etc.

## Dataset

The dataset contains flight information scraped from Kayak, covering different flight durations (1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month) and various months. The key features of the dataset include:

* Carrier: Airline providing the service.
* Departure and Arrival: Departure and arrival locations.
* Flight Duration: Total travel time.
* Layovers: Layover information.
* Price: Airfare cost.

## Project Structure

### 1. Web Scraping

Using Selenium, the airfare data was scraped for different routes and durations across multiple months. Each request resulted in a JSON file containing flight details such as carrier, departure/arrival times, and price.

### 2. Data Cleaning

In the Cleaning and EDA notebook, the scraped data was processed and cleaned:

* Handling Missing Data: Missing values were removed or filled based on the datasetâ€™s context.
* Formatting Dates: Departure and return dates were reformatted for consistency.
* Add new columns: Added new columns like Season,Total Stops and etc.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA focused on uncovering patterns in airfare prices:

* Price Trends by Month: Visualization of how airfare prices fluctuate month to month.
* Trip Duration vs Price: Analysis showing how the length of the trip affects the price.
* Top Destinations by Price: Ranking destinations based on average airfare costs.
* Airline Comparison: Comparison of average prices across different airlines.

### 4. Data Analysis and Insights

After cleaning the data, key insights were derived from the analysis:

* Optimal Booking Time: Identified the best time to book flights based on price trends.
* Price Fluctuations by Trip Duration: Found that longer trips tend to have higher airfare, but specific durations (e.g., 1-week trips) show more stable prices.
* Airline Performance: Certain airlines consistently offer cheaper flights for specific routes, providing cost-saving insights.
